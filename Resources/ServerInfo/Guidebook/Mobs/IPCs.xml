  # I.P.C.

  ### Homeworld
  Earth, technically.

  ### Temperament
  IPC tend to be Analytical in nature, enjoying jobs and tasks that allow them to flex their curiosity and experiment with the world around them.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Goblin - IPC's and Goblins tend to get along very well.  The nearly ubiquitous desire for learning from IPC mixes very well with the Goblin desire to just try new ideas.

  Slime People - IPC have a slight - and often totally uncalled for - fear of the Slimier members of crew, usually revolving around rumors of short circuiting.

  Reptilians - Many IPC find the cold calculating nature that causes some of their reptilian crewmates to fall well in line with their own often analytical natures.

  An IPC (short for Integrated Positronic Chassis) is a type of sentient robot and is considered an [color=goldenrod]independent individual[/color], meaning [color=red]they are not guided by any laws of robotics[/color]. IPCs cannot be hacked by Emags because they do not have to follow any predefined directives in their system. [color=red]IPCs are silicon-based beings, so doctors often do not have the skills to repair them.[/color]

  Like borgs, IPCs have a positronic brain as their processing source. However, unlike them, IPCs can't be assembled. "It's cheaper to create a shell that obeys you than one that doesn't! *wink*"

  ### Perks
  IPCs have the following perks:
  - They are immune to [color=limegreen]toxins[/color], [color=palegreen]drugs[/color], and [color=olivedrab]alcohol[/color].
  - They take 50% reduced [color=lime]Radiation[/color] damage.
  - They take 20% reduced [color=pink]Brute[/color] damage.
  - They are also immune to the effects of [color=lightsteelblue]space[/color], [color=lightslategray]low pressure[/color], and [color=cyan]cold[/color].
  - They do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
  - They are easy to revive, just repair the damage and hit the "Restart" button in the right-click menu.
  - Their power cell can be swapped out with a self-charging one, to never need to recharge again!
  - They have a built-in [color=goldenrod]headset[/color] and do not need to carry one.
  - IPC specific chems work regardless of if they're alive or not.

  ### Drawbacks
  IPCs have the following drawbacks:
  - They are vulnerable to [color=lightskyblue]EMP[/color] damage, which will drain your battery.
  - They are slowed by low battery, by up to 90% at 0 charge.
  - They take 50% more [color=orange]Burn[/color] damage.
  - Their topicals are specialized, storage inefficient, and relatively expensive.
  - They need IPC specific chems to be healed.

  ## Recharging an IPC
  <Box>

	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BorgCharger" Caption="Cyborg Recharging Station"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PowerCellMedium" Caption="Power Cell"/>
  </Box>
  IPCs can be recharged in three different ways:

  APC Terminal: IPCs can use APC terminals to recharge. Press [color=goldenrod]Alt + left click[/color] on a terminal as many times as needed to fully recharge.

  Cyborg Recharging Station: IPCs can use borg rechargers to recharge. These can be found within a few locations throughout the sector.

  Power Cell: IPCs have an internal power cell that serves as their battery. They can simply swap it out by opening the hatch and manually replacing it.

  ## Integrated Radio

  </Box>

  IPCs can choose not to use external radios because they already have one built in. They only need to get an encryption key from a radio. By clicking on an IPC with a [color=yellow]wirecutter[/color], you can remove their keys.
  You can find new keys around the sector or remove one from a radio using a [color=yellow]screwdriver[/color].

  ## Repairing
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RepairSpray" Caption=""/>
    Repair sprays are used to cure extensive [color=orange]Burn[/color] damage.
  </Box>
	Repair Spray restores [color=darkred]Blood level[/color], repairs some [color=darkred]Bloodloss[/color] and helps stop [color=darkred]Bleeding[/color].
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RepairPatch" Caption=""/>
    Repair Patches are used to cure moderate [color=pink]Brute[/color] damage.
  </Box>
	Repair Patches innately repair some [color=darkred]Bloodloss[/color] but do not stop [color=darkred]Bleeding[/color].
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RepairAutoinjector" Caption=""/>
	Emergency Repair autoinjectors contain 20u of [color=seagreen]Autosolder[/color] and 10u of [color=steelblue]Sylexalin[/color]!
  </Box>
  ## IPC Chems
	- [color=seagreen]Autosolder[/color] is used to repair [color=yellow]Blindness[/color], as well as [color=lime]Radiation[/color] and [color=orange]Burn[/color] damage.
	- [color=steelblue]Sylexalin[/color] is used to restore [color=darkred]blood level[/color] and remove [color=darkred]bloodloss[/color].
	- [color=violet]Sylashizine[/color] is used to restore heavy [color=pink]Piercing[/color] and [color=pink]Slash[/color] damage. [color=violet]Sylashizine[/color] also helps stop [color=darkred]Bleeding[/color] but deals minor [color=pink]Blunt[/color] damage in the process.
	- [color=darkred]Oxidant[/color] is their [color=darkred]blood[/color].


	In the event an IPC dies, after being fully repaired, it should be restarted using the [color=goldenrod]"Restart"[/color] button (located by right-clicking).

    [color=red]DO NOT DEFIBRILLATE OR SHOCK A DEAD IPC. They'll explode and probably kill you too![/color]
